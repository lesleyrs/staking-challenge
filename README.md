# Staking Challenge
Duel Arena simulation

My first game made with https://github.com/jjant/runty8.

Based on https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Duel_Arena which was removed.

Playable on web! (resizing breaks the game as it doesn't scale):

### Controls
Controls are `X` for cross/accept, `C` for circle/cancel (in this case it's only for investing), `arrow keys` to select.

`1 stack` equals to roughly 2147 million or a 32 bit signed integer
